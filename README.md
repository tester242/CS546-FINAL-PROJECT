# CS546-FINAL-PROJECT
Repo for website build for CS546's final project (Group 17)
Two branches exist in this repository, DEV and MAIN
DEV branch exists to push code done initally for better/further testing with the Group
MAIN branch exists for when the group has decided that a build of DEV is stable enough to merge as the "offical" code
To run code, first do "npm install (dependency)", substituting (dependency) for every dependency in package.json under dependencies. 
Then run "npm start" to get the server running and enter localhost:3000 into your browser to open the website.
